# High-Frequency-Amplifier
A high-frequency amplifier designed to drive an 8-ohm speaker without distortion, operating from 20kHz to 100kHz. Features a two-stage design: a common emitter pre-amplifier and a class AB power amplifier with voltage buffers. Includes design, simulation, prototype development, and testing results.
